vim_setup_settings
==================
Portable Vim settings including various plugins.
The plugins I claim no ownership over and have the utmost respect for their creators.  Plugins include Tim Pope's pathogen, Scrooloose's NERDTree, and more.

Tested working on:
  - Ubuntu 12.04
  - Mac OSX 10.94
    - Requires manual installation of fonts
  - Cygwin 32-bit

-----------------------------------------------------
If simply cloning:
  - Clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/egalpin/vim_settings.git```
  - Navigate to the cloned location
  - run ```./vimSetup.sh```
    - Note that on most systems, the script may need to be run with sudo in order to allow for compilation of dependencies (ctags)
  - Install fonts from the home directory ```fonts``` folder

-----------------------------------------------------
